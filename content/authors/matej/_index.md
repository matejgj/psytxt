I am the "what if" type who raises a lot more questions than he can answer. That's also the main reason I enrolled in a PhD program after working as a software engineer for years.

I have always been interested in psychology, but only as a hobby. That changed when I started reading up on ML and NLP in particular and came up with the idea of combining these fields with psychology.

I am currently focusing on developing resources that can help overcome the challenge of automatically recognizing personality traits from text.

In my spare time, I enjoy conducting psychological experiments on myself and stepping out of my comfort zone. I enjoy ultra trail running, rock and alpine climbing, and mountaineering. 
My most notable experiences include completing a 173km trail running race and climbing a 7000m mountain.
