We are a team of **computer scientists** that want to be **psychologists** and **psychologists** that want to be **computer scientists**.

With this project, we aim to set the ground for a **truly interdisciplinary** perspective on
computational personality research by developing datasets and models for personality
prediction and analysis based on online textual interactions. The overarching goal of our
project is to **bring the two communities closer together** and ultimately increase their capacity
to carry out relevant and valid research using computational text analysis methods,
contributing to **both** research fields. To this end, the project will focus on three research
objectives: 
1. Development of datasets adequate for text-based personality research.
2. Development of comprehensive NLP models for personality prediction and analysis.
3. Investigating a number of research questions that relate personality psychology to
language use by means of confirmatory and exploratory studies that leverage the developed
datasets and computational models.


We are part of the [Text Analysis and Knowledge Engineering Lab](http://www.takelab.fer.hr) at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en).
