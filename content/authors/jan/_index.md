I am an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER) at the University of Zagreb and a member of Text Analysis and Knowledge Engineering Lab (TakeLab). My research interests are in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. My current focus is on lexical semantics, information extraction, and opinion mining. I am a fan of functional programming, Haskell in particular.
